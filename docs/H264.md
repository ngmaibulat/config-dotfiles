The issue with H264 GPU acceleration in some Linux distributions, notably Fedora and openSUSE, arises from legal concerns related to patent and licensing for H264/H265 codecs. The open-source graphics library Mesa, used in these distributions, has had a change in its configuration that disables the decoding of various codecs such as h264dec, h264enc, h265dec, h265enc, and vc1dec via GPU on AMD/Intel GPU devices. This change affects users who rely on Mesa for video decoding on these GPU devices.

This decision was driven by the complex nature of open-source patents and licensing, with the aim of avoiding legal issues for Red Hat, the sponsor of Fedora, and other Fedora distributors. The concern is that providing support for these codecs could potentially expose them to legal problems due to the patent licensing around H264/H265.

The impact of this change is significant for users with AMD GPUs since AMD relies entirely on Mesa for these codecs. Users of Intel GPUs won't be affected as they have other means of VA-API hardware decoding, and NVIDIA users have proprietary drivers supporting these codecs. The removal of support for H.264, H.265, and VC-1 from Mesa in Fedora and openSUSE has created dissatisfaction among users, particularly as it may lead to increased CPU load and faster battery drain in laptops.

For Fedora users, a possible workaround is available through RPM Fusion, a software repository hosted in Europe, where the software is not subject to the same patent rights as in the US. Users can add this repository to their systems and install a package that restores support for these codecs. OpenSUSE users might expect a similar approach, although specific details were not available.

This situation highlights the challenges faced by community-driven Linux distributions, especially those backed by corporations, in navigating the complex landscape of patent laws and open-source licensing【5†source】【6†source】【7†source】.



Arch Linux users are not entirely immune to issues related to H264 GPU acceleration. However, the nature of these issues can differ from those experienced by Fedora and openSUSE users.

1. **Multiple Acceleration Methods**: Arch Linux offers various ways to achieve hardware-video-acceleration, including VA-API, VDPAU, AMF, and NVDEC/NVENC. Users can install multiple of these or just one, depending on their needs and the specific hardware they are using.

2. **Driver Support and Configuration**: The Arch Wiki provides detailed guidance on installing and configuring video drivers for different GPU manufacturers like Intel, NVIDIA, and AMD/ATI. Depending on the GPU, users might need to install specific drivers or translation layers to enable hardware acceleration. For example, Intel Graphics series from Broadwell and newer are supported by the `intel-media-driver`, while older models might require the `libva-intel-driver`.

3. **Issues with Specific Browsers and Updates**: There have been instances where users experienced problems with H264 acceleration in browsers like Firefox and Chromium following updates. This could be due to various reasons, such as changes in browser settings, driver updates, or system upgrades. In some cases, users found workarounds by switching browsers or adjusting browser settings to re-enable VA-API.

4. **NVIDIA Driver Regression**: A specific issue was noted with the Series 525 of the NVIDIA driver, which introduced a regression that broke VA-API. Users were advised to downgrade the drivers or use an experimental backend as a temporary solution. However, it's important to check the latest status of this issue as it might have been resolved in subsequent updates.

In summary, while Arch Linux users have access to a range of tools and drivers for enabling H264 GPU acceleration, they may still encounter specific issues related to browser updates, driver compatibility, and system configurations. The key to resolving these issues often lies in careful configuration and staying updated with the latest developments in drivers and software packages.
