### Monitor

- if choosing big monitor -- take one with vertical resolution at least 3000 pixels. That would allow to stack 2 VM windows.
Lower than that, would make almost same expierence as laptop/macbook expierence.
- displayport preferable over HDMI
- USB-C ports are welcome.
- Good to have output power over USB-C. So monitor can charge your laptop/phone/whatever

### CPU

- Prefer AMD over Intel

### RAM

- DDR5 can have 32GB modules for laptops
- DDR5 can have 48GB modules for PC

### Graphics

- Prefer AMD. Better drivers, better support for Wayland.

### Mouse

- Logitech MX Anywhere 3
